                <h2>1. Our Service Philosophy</h2>
                <p>CNX Concierge serves international professionals—Voyagers—relocating to Northern Thailand. We call our clients Voyagers because they are defined by intention, not just movement. They cross borders to participate, not consume.</p>
                <p>The finest concierge never waits to be asked. We anticipate needs, prepare solutions, and execute with discretion. Every client receives the same standard of care: punctuality, accuracy, professional documentation, and complete attention to their specific journey. We do not use client tiers or membership levels. Every engagement is treated as if you are our only client.</p>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the relationship between you (the Client) and CNX Concierge. By engaging our services, you agree to these terms.</p>

                <h2>2. Service Scope and Engagement</h2>
                <p><strong>Services Provided:</strong></p>
                <p>CNX Concierge offers comprehensive support for international professionals in Northern Thailand, including but not limited to:</p>

                    <li>Settlement services (accommodation, banking, utilities, coworking access)</li>
                    <li>Company formation and legal structuring</li>

                    <li>Employer of Record (EOR) and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Service Delivery:</strong></p>
                <p>Each engagement begins with an initial consultation to understand your specific needs. We provide transparent scoping and pricing before work begins. Services are delivered through a combination of direct concierge support and our vetted partner network.</p>

                <p><strong>No Obligation Consultation:</strong></p>
                <p>Initial consultations and preliminary assessments are provided without obligation or charge.</p>

                <h2>3. Pricing and Payment Terms</h2>
                <p><strong>Transparent Pricing:</strong></p>
                <p>We do not publish fixed pricing. Every engagement is scoped to your specific situation. You will receive a clear proposal outlining services, deliverables, timeline, and fees before any work begins.</p>

                <p><strong>Payment Structure:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>Initial deposit may be required for certain services (typically 25-50% of project value)</li>
                    <li>Remaining balance due upon completion or according to agreed milestone schedule</li>
                    <li>Recurring services (90-day reports, ongoing compliance) billed monthly or quarterly as agreed</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Accepted Payment Methods:</strong></p>
                <p>Bank transfer (Thai baht or major currencies), credit card (where available), or other methods as mutually agreed.</p>

                <p><strong>Currency:</strong></p>
                <p>Fees quoted in Thai baht (THB) unless otherwise specified. Exchange rate fluctuations are the client's responsibility for payments in foreign currencies.</p>

                <h2>4. Our Full Refund Guarantee</h2>
                <p><strong>Commitment to Delivery:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Refund Conditions:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">

                    <li>Deliverables that do not meet the specifications outlined in our agreement</li>
                    <li>Services terminated by CNX Concierge due to our inability to fulfill the engagement</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Refund Process:</strong></p>
                <p>Submit a refund request in writing to contact@cnxconcierge.com within 14 days of the service issue. Refunds are processed within 7 business days of approval. Refunds are issued to the original payment method.</p>

                <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong></p>
                <p>Refunds do not apply to:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>Third-party fees (government filing fees, legal fees, bank charges) already paid on your behalf</li>
                    <li>Services completed to specification but where outcome is affected by external factors (visa denials due to applicant ineligibility, regulatory changes beyond our control)</li>
                    <li>Services terminated by the client for reasons other than our failure to deliver</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Partial Refunds:</strong></p>
                <p>If only part of a service engagement is undelivered, partial refunds are calculated proportionally.</p>

                <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
                <p><strong>Accurate Information:</strong></p>
                <p>You must provide complete, accurate, and timely information required for service delivery. Delays or errors caused by incomplete or inaccurate client information are your responsibility.</p>

                <p><strong>Document Provision:</strong></p>
                <p>You must provide all necessary documents (passports, business registration, financial records, etc.) in the format and timeline requested.</p>

                <p><strong>Timely Payment:</strong></p>
                <p>Payment according to agreed terms is required for service continuation.</p>

                <p><strong>Compliance:</strong></p>
                <p>You are responsible for ensuring your activities in Thailand comply with all applicable laws. CNX Concierge provides guidance and support but does not assume legal responsibility for your compliance.</p>

                <p><strong>Communication:</strong></p>
                <p>You must maintain responsive communication. If we cannot reach you for more than 14 days, we may pause service delivery.</p>

                <h2>6. Confidentiality and Discretion</h2>
                <p><strong>Absolute Confidentiality:</strong></p>
                <p>All information you provide is held in strict confidence. We do not publish client testimonials, case studies, or reference lists. The matters we handle are confidential by nature.</p>

                <p><strong>Non-Disclosure:</strong></p>
                <p>We do not disclose your engagement with CNX Concierge without your explicit written consent, except where required by Thai law or court order.</p>

                <p><strong>Internal Use Only:</strong></p>
                <p>Your information is used solely for service delivery, legal compliance, and internal quality assurance. Staff are bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>

                <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong></p>
                <p>Your personal data is protected according to our Privacy Policy and Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

                <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p><strong>Service Delivery Standard:</strong></p>
                <p>CNX Concierge commits to delivering services with professional care, accuracy, and diligence. However, we cannot guarantee outcomes controlled by third parties (government approvals, visa decisions, regulatory processes).</p>

                <p><strong>Liability Cap:</strong></p>
                <p>Our total liability to you for any claim arising from our services is limited to the amount you paid for the specific service in question.</p>

                <p><strong>No Consequential Damages:</strong></p>
                <p>We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages (lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm) arising from service delivery or delays.</p>

                <p><strong>Third-Party Actions:</strong></p>
                <p>We are not responsible for actions, errors, or delays by third parties (government agencies, partner service providers, banks) even when we coordinate their services on your behalf.</p>

                <p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong></p>
                <p>We are not liable for failure to perform due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control (natural disasters, government actions, pandemics, civil unrest, internet/utility outages).</p>

                <h2>8. Termination</h2>
                <p><strong>Termination by Client:</strong></p>
                <p>You may terminate services at any time with written notice. You will be invoiced for work completed to date. Unused advance payments (minus completed work) will be refunded.</p>

                <p><strong>Termination by CNX Concierge:</strong></p>
                <p>We may terminate services if:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <li>You fail to provide required information or documentation after reasonable requests</li>
                    <li>You fail to make payment according to agreed terms</li>
                    <li>You engage in illegal activity or request services that violate Thai law</li>
                    <li>Continued service would require us to violate our professional or ethical standards</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong></p>
                <p>Upon termination, we will provide all documents and work product completed to date. Outstanding invoices remain payable. Confidentiality obligations survive termination indefinitely.</p>

                <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p><strong>Good Faith Discussion:</strong></p>
                <p>If any dispute arises, we commit to resolving it through direct, good faith discussion before pursuing formal proceedings.</p>

                <p><strong>Governing Law:</strong></p>
                <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Kingdom of Thailand.</p>

                <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong></p>
                <p>Any disputes that cannot be resolved through discussion will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Chiang Mai, Thailand.</p>

                <p>These Terms and Conditions, together with any service-specific agreements and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and CNX Concierge.</p>

                <p><strong>Amendments:</strong></p>
                <p>We may update these terms by posting a revised version on cnxconcierge.com with a new effective date. Material changes will be communicated directly to active clients. Continued use of services after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

                <p><strong>Severability:</strong></p>
                <p>If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.</p>

                <p><strong>Waiver:</strong></p>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right.</p>

                <p><strong>Assignment:</strong></p>
                <p>You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these terms without our written consent. We may assign our rights to a successor entity.</p>

                <p><strong>Language:</strong></p>
