        <h1>Enter CNX</h1>
        <p>Concierge services for those who cross borders with intention.</p>
        
        <p>CNX Concierge serves international professionals who move to Northern Thailand. We handle the complexity of arrival: visas, documents, settlement. This allows our clients to focus on why they came. For those building businesses, we provide company formation, legal structure, and access to trusted local partners. One relationship. Every stage.</p>
        
        <p>Enter CNX. Where Voyagers arrive with intention, we ensure the stay honors it—brief or boundless.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="approach">
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        
        <h2>Voyagers</h2>
        <h3>Who we serve</h3>
        <p>We call our clients Voyagers. They are defined by intention, not just movement. They cross borders to participate, not consume. Like Marco Polo, whose journeys created pathways for trade and connection, today's Voyagers build bridges that algorithms cannot replicate. They choose presence over abstraction. CNX Concierge exists to serve this purpose.</p>
        
        <h2>The Art of Anticipation</h2>
        <h3>How we work</h3>
        <p>The finest concierge never waits to be asked. We anticipate needs, prepare solutions, and execute with discretion. Whether arranging a first apartment or structuring a company, we ensure every detail is handled so the Voyager's attention remains on what matters most.</p>
        
        <h2>The CNX Gateway</h2>
        <h3>Our territory</h3>
        <p>CNX represents the greater Chiang Mai region: Chiang Mai Province, Lamphun, and the surrounding Lanna highlands. This is our territory. We know its rhythms, networks, and opportunities. CNX Concierge serves as the trusted gateway to this region.</p>
        
        <h2>One Relationship, Every Stage</h2>
        <h3>Continuous partnership</h3>
        <p>A Voyager's journey evolves from exploration to extension to permanent roots. CNX Concierge accompanies every stage within a single, continuous relationship: from visa processing to company formation. No handoffs. One trusted partner throughout.</p>
        
        <h2>Discretion</h2>
        <h3>Our principle</h3>
        <p>We do not publish client testimonials or reference past engagements. The matters we handle are confidential by nature. Trust cannot coexist with disclosure. Discretion is not a policy. It is a principle.</p>
