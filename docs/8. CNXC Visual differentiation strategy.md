# CNX Brand Visual Differentiation Strategy

## Intentional Asymmetry: Why the Two Identities Must Not Share Visual Elements

---

The dual-identity architecture separates CNX Concierge (corporate entity) from cnx.guide (digital product) for strategic reasons. This separation must be preserved visually — not just verbally.

Sharing the Lanna Lantern symbol or typography between both brands would collapse the architecture back into a single identity with two names, defeating the purpose of the separation entirely. The corporate layer requires institutional gravitas; the product layer requires approachable warmth. These are incompatible visual languages.

The connection between the two brands is verbal, not visual. The shared "CNX" prefix provides spoken recognition. The attribution line ("a service of CNX Concierge") establishes the relationship in legal and footer contexts. Nothing more is required.

## Intentional Asymmetry

| Element | CNX Concierge | cnx.guide |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Symbol** | None | Lanna Lantern |
| **Typography** | Elegant serif | Modern sans-serif |
| **Color** | Ink / neutral | Ink + warm gold |
| **Tone** | Institutional, minimal | Friendly, action-oriented |
| **Domain** | cnxconcierge.com | cnx.guide |
| **Marketing** | None — exists to be found | Active — optimized for search and social |

## The Principle

The Lanna Lantern belongs exclusively to cnx.guide. It is the product signature — the lit path, the friendly guide, the digital welcome. CNX Concierge stands on its name alone, as a serious consulting practice should. Typography carries the weight; no symbol is needed or appropriate.

The brands share three letters: C, N, X. The verbal echo is sufficient. Visual separation preserves the architecture, protects the parent brand from product-level volatility, and allows each identity to operate at full strength within its intended context.

This is not a stylistic preference. It is a structural requirement.
