# CNX Concierge — Brand & Communication Brief

## Creative Direction for Corporate Identity

---

## A. Brand Context

### A1. What Is CNX Concierge?

CNX Concierge is the legal entity and corporate identity for a high-end service agency based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It serves international travelers ("Voyagers") who relocate to Northern Thailand — handling visas, company formation, legal structuring, and strategic partnerships.

### A2. Positioning

CNX Concierge operates like a **law firm** or **elite advisory practice** — not a travel agency, not a visa shop, not a startup. The brand must communicate:

- Institutional credibility
- Professional discretion
- Quiet confidence
- Established expertise

### A3. What CNX Concierge Is Not

| CNX Concierge Is | CNX Concierge Is Not |
|------------------|----------------------|
| A consulting practice | A tech startup |
| Formal and measured | Casual or playful |
| Confident and quiet | Loud or promotional |
| For those who seek it | For mass-market appeal |
| Typography-driven | Symbol-driven |

### A4. Relationship to cnx.guide

CNX Concierge is the **parent entity**. cnx.guide is the **digital product** — a separate brand with its own visual identity (the Lanna Lantern symbol, modern typography, warm gold accents).

**Critical Rule:** CNX Concierge and cnx.guide do not share visual elements. No symbol appears on CNX Concierge materials. The connection is verbal only ("cnx.guide is a service of CNX Concierge").

---

## B. Logo & Wordmark

### B1. Core Requirement

The CNX Concierge logo is **typography only**. No symbol. No icon. No graphic mark.

The name itself is the logo. The letterforms carry the entire identity.

### B2. Rationale

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Differentiation** | cnx.guide carries the Lanna Lantern; CNX Concierge must be visually distinct |
| **Institutional tone** | Law firms, private banks, and elite consultancies use wordmarks, not icons |
| **Timelessness** | Typography ages gracefully; symbols trend and date |
| **Confidence** | A name that stands alone signals self-assurance |

### B3. Typography Direction

**Approved Typeface:**
- **Trirong** (Google Fonts) — Traditional Thai serif with native Thai script support
- Narrow, tall structure reminiscent of traditional Thai typography
- Thick and thin strokes with oval-shaped looped terminals
- Formal, institutional appearance that honors Thai typographic heritage
- Weights: 400 (Regular), 600 (Semi-bold), 700 (Bold)
- Styles: Regular, Italic

**Mandatory:**
- Trirong is the approved and exclusive typeface for CNX Concierge
- High legibility at all sizes
- Elegant proportions — not compressed, not extended
- Professional character — no quirks, no novelty
- Full support for both Latin and Thai scripts

**Source:** [Google Fonts — Trirong](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Trirong)

### B4. Wordmark Composition

**Approved Format:**
```
CNX CONCIERGE
```

**Specifications:**
- Font: Trirong
- Weight: 700 (Bold)
- Case: ALL CAPS
- Letter-spacing: 0.1em
- Color: CNX Navy (#0c2b5c) on light backgrounds
- Color: White (#ffffff) on dark backgrounds (negative application)

**Variations:**
- Horizontal layout (primary)
- Stacked layout acceptable for constrained spaces
- No separator, no decorative elements, no flourishes

### B5. Case Treatment

| Treatment | Suitability |
|-----------|-------------|
| ALL CAPS | Formal, authoritative — preferred |
| Title Case | Softer, more approachable — acceptable |
| lowercase | Too casual — not permitted |

---

## C. Color Palette

### C1. Primary Palette

CNX Concierge uses the **CNX Deep Navy palette** (Palette 2) as the approved brand color system. The palette is built around CNX Navy as the primary brand color, positioning the brand alongside private banks and advisory practices while maintaining institutional credibility.

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **CNX Navy** | #0c2b5c | Primary brand color, wordmark, key headings |
| **CNX Light Paper** | #f7f8fb | Main background for content areas, section containers |
| **Harbor Gray** | #59647a | Secondary text, captions, metadata, dividers |
| **Lavender Accent** | #76235f | Links, interactive elements, subtle callouts (maximum 10% of visual space) |
| **Ink** | #1a1a1a | Body text on light backgrounds (optimal readability) |
| **White** | #ffffff | Cards, panels, elevated content, negative application |
| **Border** | #e0e0e0 | Dividers, borders, subtle separators |

### C2. Accent Color Usage

**Lavender Accent (#76235f)** must be used sparingly:
- Links and hover states
- Small callouts and highlights
- Subtle UI elements (buttons, icons)
- Maximum 10% of visual space
- Never used as background flood
- Never used for large text blocks

**Mandatory:** No bright colors. No gradients. No competing hues. The palette remains restrained and professional. Color supports content but never dominates.

### C3. Rationale

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Navy-led system** | CNX Navy positions the brand alongside private banks and advisory practices, conveying institutional credibility |
| **Restrained application** | Color supports content but never dominates; typography and whitespace lead the design |
| **Timelessness** | Navy-led palettes age gracefully and maintain professional gravitas |
| **Print compatibility** | Works effectively in both color and black-and-white applications |
| **Differentiation** | cnx.guide uses warm gold prominently; CNX Concierge uses navy-led system |

---

## D. Typography System

### D1. Hierarchy

**Approved Typeface:** Trirong (all levels)

| Level | Usage | Specifications |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **H1** | Page titles, hero statements | 3rem / 700 (Bold) / 1.2 line-height / CNX Navy |
| **H2** | Section headers | 2rem / 600 (Semi-bold) / 1.3 line-height / CNX Navy |
| **H3** | Subsection headers | 1.5rem / 600 (Semi-bold) / 1.4 line-height / CNX Navy |
| **Body** | Paragraphs, descriptions | 1.05rem / 400 (Regular) / 1.7 line-height / Ink (#1a1a1a) |
| **Caption** | Labels, metadata | 0.9rem / 400 (Regular) / 1.6 line-height / Harbor Gray (#59647a) |
| **Wordmark** | Brand identity | Variable size / 700 (Bold) / 0.1em letter-spacing / CNX Navy or White |

### D2. Typography Rules

**Single Typeface System:** Trirong is used for all text elements. No font pairing required. The typeface carries the entire identity through weight and size variations.

**Bilingual Support:** Trirong provides native support for both Latin and Thai scripts, enabling seamless bilingual content without font switching.

### D3. Mandatory Rules

- Minimum body text size: 16px (1rem) for web, 10pt for print
- Line height: 1.7 for body text (optimal readability)
- Maximum line width: 70–80 characters (prevents eye strain)
- No decorative or display fonts
- No bold overuse — use 600 (Semi-bold) and 700 (Bold) weights appropriately
- Maintain generous whitespace between elements

## E. Voice & Tone

### E1. Brand Voice

CNX Concierge speaks with **quiet authority**. The voice is:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Confident** | Statements, not qualifications. No hedging. |
| **Measured** | Every word earns its place. No filler. |
| **Direct** | Clear and precise. No jargon, no fluff. |
| **Respectful** | Professional courtesy. Never condescending. |
| **Discreet** | Understated. The work speaks; the brand does not boast. |

### E2. Tone Examples

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "We're super excited to help you!" | "We are prepared to assist." |
| "Our amazing team of experts" | "Our team" |
| "Don't hesitate to reach out!" | "Contact us." |
| "We offer a wide range of services" | "Our services include..." |
| "Thailand's #1 visa agency!" | [Never. No superlatives.] |

### E3. Sentence Structure

- Prefer short sentences
- Active voice over passive
- Subject-verb-object construction
- No exclamation marks
- Minimal adjectives

### E4. Tagline / Positioning Line

**Current:**
> *Enter CNX. Where Voyagers arrive with intention, we ensure the stay honors it — brief or boundless.*

This line may appear on institutional materials. It is not a marketing slogan — it is a philosophical statement.

---

## F. Language Strategy

### F1. Primary Language

**English** is the primary language for all CNX Concierge communications. The target audience is international, English-speaking Voyagers.

### F2. Secondary Languages

| Language | Usage | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Thai** | Legal documents, official filings, local partner communications | Required for Thai regulatory compliance |
| **Italian** | Select marketing materials, partnership contexts | Heritage connection (Italian Connection parent entity); Italian client segment |

### F3. Implementation

| Material | Language(s) |
|----------|-------------|
| Website (cnxconcierge.com) | English only |
| Legal contracts | English + Thai (bilingual) |
| Partner communications | English or Thai (as appropriate) |
| Italian partnership materials | English + Italian |
| Internal documentation | English |

### F4. Translation Standards

- All translations by professional native speakers
- Legal translations certified where required
- No machine translation for client-facing materials
- Maintain consistent terminology across languages

## G. Website (cnxconcierge.com)

### G1. Purpose

The website is an **institutional presence** — not a marketing funnel. It exists to:

- Establish credibility
- Communicate philosophy and methodology
- Provide contact information
- Serve due diligence inquiries (partners, press, legal)

It does **not** exist to:

- Generate leads
- Convert visitors
- Compete on SEO
- Promote services aggressively

### G2. Structure

**Mandatory Pages:**

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Home** | Positioning statement, brief introduction, navigation to key sections |
| **Philosophy** | Vision, mission, the Voyager ethos |
| **Services** | High-level service categories (not a detailed menu) |
| **Team** | Founding team, credentials, professional backgrounds |
| **Contact** | Email, physical address, contact form |

**Optional Pages:**

| Page | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Partners** | Strategic partnerships, affiliations |
| **Press** | Media inquiries, press kit |

### G3. Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Minimalism** | Maximum whitespace. Content breathes. |
| **Typography-first** | The typeface is the design. No decorative elements. |
| **No stock photography** | If images are used, they must be original or high-quality editorial. No smiling businesspeople. No handshakes. |
| **No animations** | Subtle transitions acceptable. No parallax, no scroll-triggered effects. |
| **No pop-ups** | No newsletter prompts, no chat widgets, no cookie banners beyond legal minimum. |

### G4. Visual Elements

**Permitted:**

- Generous whitespace
- Thin horizontal rules (dividers)
- Subtle background color blocks (paper tones)
- High-quality photography (if any) — architectural, landscape, editorial

**Not Permitted:**

- Icons or illustrations
- The Lanna Lantern symbol (belongs to cnx.guide only)
- Gradients or color overlays
- Stock photography
- Decorative graphics

### G5. Interaction Design

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Links** | Underlined or subtle color shift. No buttons for text links. |
| **Buttons** | Minimal. Rectangular, no rounded corners, solid fill or outline. |
| **Forms** | Simple. Labeled fields, no placeholder-only inputs. |
| **Navigation** | Top or side. Text-based. No hamburger menu on desktop. |

### G6. Mobile Responsiveness

**Mandatory:** Fully responsive design. The experience on mobile must be equally refined — not a compressed desktop version.

## H. Print Materials

### H1. Business Cards

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Size** | Standard (85 × 55 mm) or US (89 × 51 mm) |
| **Stock** | Heavy weight (350gsm+), uncoated or soft-touch matte |
| **Color** | Single color (CNX Navy) or two-color (CNX Navy + Lavender Accent) |
| **Content — Front** | Name, title, wordmark |
| **Content — Back** | Contact details, website, optional tagline |
| **Finish** | No gloss. Consider letterpress or deboss for wordmark. |

### H2. Letterhead & Documents

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Paper** | Premium uncoated stock, natural white or cream |
| **Header** | Wordmark top-left or centered |
| **Footer** | Contact details, registration information |
| **Margins** | Generous (minimum 25mm all sides) |
| **Typography** | Consistent with brand system |

### H3. Brochures & Collateral

**General Principles:**

- **Less is more.** A 4-page document with breathing room outperforms a 12-page dense booklet.
- **Typography leads.** Large pull quotes, generous headings, restrained body text.
- **No hard sell.** Informative, not persuasive.
- **Photography (if used):** Editorial quality. Chiang Mai architecture, Lanna landscapes, temple details. No people unless essential.

**Creative Freedom:** Format, fold, and binding are open to creative interpretation within the tonal parameters.

## I. Photography Guidelines

### I1. If Photography Is Used

Photography is **optional** for CNX Concierge. The brand can function entirely on typography and whitespace. However, if images are included:

**Permitted Subjects:**

| Subject | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Chiang Mai architecture | Territory connection, visual interest |
| Lanna temple details | Cultural authenticity |
| Northern Thailand landscapes | Sense of place |
| Abstract textures | Paper, stone, wood — tactile, grounded |

**Not Permitted:**

| Subject | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Stock business imagery | Generic, undermines credibility |
| Smiling portraits | Too casual, too promotional |
| Tourist clichés | Elephants, tuk-tuks, pad thai — not this brand |
| Digital/tech imagery | Screens, devices, code — belongs to cnx.guide |

### I2. Photography Style

| Attribute | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Color grading** | Muted, desaturated, warm undertones |
| **Composition** | Considered. Architectural. Rule of thirds or centered symmetry. |
| **Lighting** | Natural. Soft. No harsh flash or artificial lighting. |
| **Mood** | Quiet, contemplative, unhurried |

---

## J. What Must Not Appear

### J1. Absolute Prohibitions

| Element | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Lanna Lantern symbol** | Belongs exclusively to cnx.guide |
| **Bright or saturated colors** | Conflicts with institutional tone |
| **Exclamation marks** | Too casual |
| **Superlatives ("best," "#1," "leading")** | Undermines quiet confidence |
| **Stock photography** | Destroys credibility |
| **Decorative icons or illustrations** | Conflicts with typography-first identity |
| **Chat widgets or pop-ups** | Disrupts professional experience |
| **Playful or casual language** | Wrong tone |

---

## M. Final Note

CNX Concierge is not trying to attract attention. It is designed to reward those who seek it. The brand should feel like entering a private office where serious work is done quietly, professionally, and with complete discretion.

Every design choice should pass one test: **Would this feel at home in a respected London, Zurich, or Singapore advisory firm?**

If the answer is no, reconsider.
