# CNX Concierge — Social Media Policy

## Digital Presence Strategy for Institutional Brand

---

## A. Guiding Principle

CNX Concierge is an institutional brand. It does not pursue social media engagement, viral reach, or content marketing. The brand exists to be found by those who already know what they are looking for — not to attract casual attention.

Social media presence, where it exists, serves three limited purposes:

1. **Verification** — Prospective clients and partners can confirm the entity is real
2. **Prevention** — Handles are claimed to prevent squatting or impersonation
3. **Professional expectation** — LinkedIn presence is standard for consulting practices

Active marketing, community building, and content creation belong to **cnx.guide** — the product brand — not to CNX Concierge.

---

## B. Channel Strategy

### B1. Channel Decision Matrix

| Channel | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn** | ✓ Active (minimal) | Professional standard for consulting. Expected by B2B audience. |
| **Facebook** | ⚠ Placeholder only | Dominant in Thailand. Claim to prevent squatting. Do not post. |
| **LINE Official** | ⚠ Operational only | Thailand's primary messaging app. For client communication, not marketing. |
| **Instagram** | ✗ Do not create | Visual lifestyle platform. Incompatible with institutional tone. |
| **X / Twitter** | ✗ Do not create | News/opinion platform. No strategic fit. |
| **TikTok** | ✗ Do not create | Entertainment platform. Absolute mismatch. |
| **YouTube** | ✗ Do not create | Content-heavy platform. Nothing to broadcast. |
| **Threads** | ✗ Do not create | Meta's X competitor. No strategic fit. |
| **WeChat** | ✗ Do not create | Chinese market focus. Not target audience. |

### B2. Thailand Market Consideration

LINE and Facebook dominate Thai digital communication. However, CNX Concierge targets **international professionals**, not Thai consumers. The primary audience discovers services through:

- Google search
- Professional referrals
- LinkedIn
- Direct website visits

Thai-dominant platforms are acknowledged but not prioritized for active engagement.

## C. LinkedIn — Primary Channel

### C1. Purpose

LinkedIn is the only channel where CNX Concierge maintains active (though minimal) presence. It serves:

- Professional credibility verification
- Founder/team visibility
- Occasional institutional updates

### C2. Company Page

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Page name** | CNX Concierge |
| **Tagline** | Concierge services for international professionals in Northern Thailand |
| **About** | 150-200 words adapted from website introduction |
| **Website** | cnxconcierge.com |
| **Industry** | Business Consulting and Services |
| **Company size** | 2-10 employees |
| **Headquarters** | Chiang Mai, Thailand |
| **Logo** | Wordmark (text only, no symbol) |
| **Cover image** | Minimal — typography on neutral background, or Chiang Mai architectural photography |

### C3. Founder/Team Profiles

Each team member should maintain a complete LinkedIn profile:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Professional photo** | High quality, consistent with brand tone |
| **Headline** | Role + CNX Concierge (e.g., "Founder & Managing Director at CNX Concierge") |
| **About section** | Professional background, Thailand tenure, areas of expertise |
| **Experience** | CNX Concierge listed with description |
| **Location** | Chiang Mai, Thailand |
| **Languages** | Listed accurately |

### C4. Posting Strategy

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Frequency** | 1-2 posts per quarter maximum |
| **Tone** | Informational, measured, professional |
| **Content types** | Regulatory updates, company milestones only |
| **Engagement** | Respond to direct inquiries. Do not chase likes or comments. |
| **Hashtags** | None or minimal. Never trending hashtags. |
| **Tagging** | Only when directly relevant. No influencer tagging. |

### C5. What NOT to Post on LinkedIn

| Prohibited Content | Rationale |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Promotional offers or discounts | Undermines institutional positioning |
| Client testimonials or success stories | Violates discretion principle |
| "Thought leadership" opinion pieces | Too visible, too promotional |
| Industry commentary or news reaction | Not the brand's role |
| Team social events or celebrations | Too casual |
| Motivational quotes | Incompatible with brand voice |
| Engagement bait ("What do you think?") | Beneath the brand |
| Frequent posting | Signals desperation for attention |

---

## D. Facebook — Placeholder Only

### D1. Purpose

Claim the handle. Prevent impersonation. Provide verification touchpoint. Do not actively engage.

### D2. Page Setup

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Page name** | CNX Concierge |
| **Username** | @cnxconcierge (or closest available) |
| **Category** | Consulting Agency |
| **About** | Brief description (50 words) + website link |
| **Profile image** | Wordmark |
| **Cover image** | Minimal, consistent with LinkedIn |

---

## E. LINE Official Account — Operational Only

### E1. Purpose

LINE is Thailand's dominant messaging platform. A LINE Official Account may be necessary for **client communication** — not for marketing or broadcasting.

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|

---

## F. Channels NOT to Create

The following channels are explicitly excluded. Do not create accounts, even as placeholders:

| Channel | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Instagram** | Visual lifestyle platform incompatible with institutional brand. Would require content production that conflicts with positioning. |
| **X / Twitter** | News and opinion platform. Real-time engagement expectation conflicts with measured brand voice. |
| **TikTok** | Entertainment-first platform. Absolute mismatch with professional services positioning. |
| **YouTube** | Requires video content production. CNX Concierge has no broadcast agenda. |
| **Threads** | Meta's X competitor. Same issues as X/Twitter. |
| **Pinterest** | Visual discovery platform. No relevance to service offering. |
| **WeChat** | Chinese market focus. Not aligned with target audience. |

If any of these platforms become strategically relevant in the future, the decision should be revisited. As of this policy, they are excluded.

---

## G. Content Structure (LinkedIn Only)

Since LinkedIn is the only channel with active posting, the following content framework applies:

### G1. Permitted Content Categories

| Category | Description | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Regulatory Updates** | Changes to Thai visa rules, business regulations, compliance requirements | When relevant (estimated 2-4 per year) |
| **Company Milestones** | Significant anniversaries, expansions, new service areas | Rare (1-2 per year) |
| **Partnership Announcements** | New strategic relationships (only if partner agrees to be named) | Rare |
| **Hiring Announcements** | Senior team additions | When applicable |

### G2. Content Templates

**Regulatory Update:**

> **[Topic]: What International Professionals Should Know**
>
> [2-3 sentences explaining the change]
>
> [1-2 sentences on practical implications]
>
> For detailed guidance on how this affects your situation, contact us at cnxconcierge.com.

*Example:*

> **Thailand DTV Visa Update: Extended Validity Now Available**
>
> The Destination Thailand Visa program has been updated to allow [specific change]. This affects eligibility for [category of travelers].
>
> For applicants currently in process or considering the DTV pathway, we recommend reviewing your timeline. Contact us for specific guidance at cnxconcierge.com.

---

**Company Milestone:**

> [Brief statement of milestone]
>
> [1-2 sentences of context — what this means, not self-congratulation]
>
> [Thank you to clients/partners if appropriate — without naming]

*Example:*

> CNX Concierge marks 15 years of serving international professionals in Northern Thailand.
>
> Since 2009, we have accompanied Voyagers through arrivals, settlements, and business formations across the Lanna region. The work continues.
>
> To those who have trusted us with their journeys — thank you.

---

### G3. Formatting Rules

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Length** | Under 200 words. Shorter is better. |
| **Paragraphs** | Short. 1-3 sentences each. |
| **Emojis** | None. |
| **Hashtags** | Maximum 2. Only if highly relevant (#ThailandVisa, #ChiangMai). Never trending tags. |
| **Links** | Always to cnxconcierge.com. Never to third-party content. |
| **Images** | Optional. If used: minimal, typography-based, or high-quality Chiang Mai photography. Never stock photos. |
| **Calls to action** | Soft. "Contact us for guidance" — never "Book now!" or "Don't miss out!" |

### G4. Approval Process

All LinkedIn posts require approval before publishing:

1. Draft prepared
2. Reviewed for tone, accuracy, and brand alignment
3. Approved by founder/principal
4. Published

No spontaneous posting. No reactive content.

---

## H. Content Calendar

Given the minimal posting strategy, a traditional content calendar is unnecessary. Instead:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Thai immigration announces visa rule change | Evaluate if update post is warranted |
| Thai government announces business regulation change | Evaluate if update post is warranted |
| Company anniversary (annual) | Prepare milestone post |
| New senior team member joins | Prepare hiring announcement |
| New strategic partnership formalized | Evaluate if announcement is appropriate |

**Default:** No post. Silence is acceptable. The brand does not need to maintain "presence" through regular posting.

---

## I. Engagement Rules

### I1. Responding to Inquiries

| Channel | Response Protocol |
|---------|-------------------|
| **LinkedIn (DMs)** | Respond within 1 business day. Direct to email or website for detailed inquiries. |
| **LinkedIn (comments)** | Respond only if direct question. Keep brief. |
| **Facebook (if messaging enabled)** | Auto-reply directing to email/website. |
| **LINE** | Respond within 1 business day for existing clients. |

### I2. Handling Negative Comments

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Legitimate complaint | Respond briefly, take offline: "We'd like to address this directly. Please email [address]." |
| Spam or irrelevant | Delete without response. |
| Trolling or bad faith | Delete without response. Do not engage. |
| Competitor attack | Ignore. Do not engage. |

### I3. What NOT to Do

| Prohibited Action | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Engaging in public debates | Beneath institutional brand |
| Responding to every comment | Signals desperation for engagement |
| Liking/commenting on unrelated posts | Dilutes professional focus |
| Following accounts for visibility | Inauthentic growth tactic |
| Requesting testimonials or reviews | Violates discretion principle |

---

## J. Metrics & Measurement

CNX Concierge does not optimize for social media metrics. The following are explicitly **not** key performance indicators:

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Follower count | Not tracked |
| Post engagement rate | Not tracked |
| Impressions/reach | Not tracked |
| Share of voice | Not tracked |

### J1. What IS Monitored

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Direct inquiries via LinkedIn | Measure if channel generates legitimate leads |
| Website referral traffic from LinkedIn | Measure if channel drives site visits |
| Impersonation attempts | Security monitoring |

Review quarterly. If LinkedIn generates zero legitimate inquiries over 12 months, consider reducing activity further.

---

## K. Relationship to cnx.guide

All active social media marketing, content creation, community engagement, and audience building activities belong to **cnx.guide** — not CNX Concierge.

| Activity | CNX Concierge | cnx.guide |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Social media presence | Minimal / placeholder | Active |
| Content marketing | No | Yes |
| SEO investment | Minimal | Primary focus |
| Paid advertising | No | Potentially |
| Community engagement | No | Yes |
| Influencer collaboration | No | Potentially |
| Email marketing | No | Yes |

The two brands operate independently on social media. Cross-posting, co-branding, or shared campaigns are not appropriate.

**Exception:** cnx.guide may reference "a service of CNX Concierge" in its profile or footer, consistent with the attribution relationship.

---

## L. Summary

| Channel | Status | Activity Level |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Active | Minimal — 1-2 posts/quarter |
| **Facebook** | Placeholder | None — page exists but dormant |
| **LINE Official** | Operational | Client communication only |
| **Instagram** | None | Do not create |
| **X / Twitter** | None | Do not create |
| **TikTok** | None | Do not create |
| **YouTube** | None | Do not create |
| **Others** | None | Do not create |

---

## M. Policy Review

This policy should be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to:

- CNX Concierge brand strategy
- Social media platform landscape
- Thai digital communication norms
- Target audience behavior

Until formally revised, this document governs all CNX Concierge social media activity.

---

*CNX Concierge does not seek attention. It earns trust through discretion, competence, and results known only to those who experience them.*
