## Page-by-Page Content Structure

---

### 1. HOME

**Purpose:** First impression. Establish tone, communicate positioning, guide navigation.

**Hero Section**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | [Primary positioning statement — 5-10 words] |
| **Subheadline** | [Supporting line — 10-20 words] |

*Draft options for headline:*
- "Enter CNX"
- "The Gateway to Lanna"
- "Where Voyagers Arrive"

*Draft options for subheadline:*
- "Concierge services for those who cross borders with intention."
- "Visa, settlement, and business services for Northern Thailand."

**Introduction Paragraph**

> [50-100 words introducing CNX Concierge. What we do, who we serve, why we exist. Written in brand voice — confident, measured, direct.]

*Draft:*

> CNX Concierge serves international professionals relocating to Northern Thailand. We handle the complexity of arrival — visas, documentation, settlement — so our clients can focus on why they came. For those building businesses, we provide company formation, legal structuring, and access to trusted local partners. One relationship. Every stage.

**Navigation Section**

| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Philosophy | "Our approach to service" |
| Services | "What we provide" |
| Team | "Who we are" |
| Contact | "Begin a conversation" |

**Optional: Tagline/Closing Line**

> *Enter CNX. Where Voyagers arrive with intention, we ensure the stay honors it — brief or boundless.*

---

### 2. PHILOSOPHY

**Purpose:** Communicate vision, values, and methodology. Establish intellectual credibility.

**Page Title:** Philosophy (or "Approach" or "Who We Serve")

**Section A: The Voyager**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section headline** | "Voyagers" |
| **Body text** | [100-150 words defining the Voyager archetype] |

*Draft:*

> We call our clients Voyagers — not tourists, not expats, not digital nomads. A Voyager is defined by intention, not just movement. They cross borders to participate, not consume. They seek places where human exchange remains real, mutual, and alive.
>
> Like Marco Polo, whose journeys across continents created pathways for trade, ideas, and lasting connection, today's Voyagers build bridges that algorithms cannot replicate. They choose presence over abstraction. They contribute where they land.
>
> CNX Concierge exists to serve this ethos.

**Section B: The Art of Anticipation**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section headline** | "The Art of Anticipation" |
| **Body text** | [75-100 words on service philosophy] |

*Draft:*

> The finest concierge never waits to be asked. We anticipate needs, prepare solutions, and execute with discretion. Trust and confidentiality form our foundation.
>
> Whether arranging a first apartment or structuring a company, we operate as an invisible hand — ensuring every detail is handled so the Voyager's attention remains on what matters most.

**Section C: The Territory**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section headline** | "The CNX Gateway" |
| **Body text** | [50-75 words on geographic scope] |

*Draft:*

> CNX is more than an airport code. It represents the greater Chiang Mai region — Chiang Mai Province, Lamphun, and the surrounding Lanna highlands. This is our territory. We know its rhythms, its networks, its opportunities. CNX Concierge serves as the trusted gateway to this region.

**Section D: One Relationship**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section headline** | "One Relationship, Every Stage" |
| **Body text** | [50-75 words on continuous partnership] |

*Draft:*

> A Voyager's journey rarely follows a straight line. Intentions evolve from exploration to extension to permanent roots. CNX Concierge accompanies every stage within a single, continuous relationship — from visa processing and temporary housing to company formation and strategic partnerships. No handoffs. No restarts. One trusted partner throughout.

**Section E: Discretion**

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section headline** | "Discretion" |
| **Body text** | [50 words on privacy as principle] |

*Final copy:*

> We do not publish client testimonials or reference past engagements. The matters we handle are confidential by nature, and trust cannot coexist with disclosure. Our reputation is known to those who need to know it. Discretion is not a policy — it is a principle.

---

### 3. SERVICES

**Purpose:** Communicate service scope at a high level. Not a detailed menu — a statement of capability.

**Page Title:** Services

**Introduction Paragraph**

> [50-75 words framing the service offering]

*Draft:*

> CNX Concierge provides end-to-end support for international professionals in Northern Thailand. Our services span the full journey — from first arrival to established operations. We begin with the practical and evolve toward the strategic as your commitment deepens.

**Service Categories**

Present as **three tiers** or **three columns** — not a long list.

| Category | Headline | Description | Example Services |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Arrival** | "Landing" | First steps in Thailand | Visa processing (DTV, extensions, 90-day reports), airport reception, initial orientation |
| **Settlement** | "Grounding" | Establishing a base | Accommodation search, bank account setup, mobile/internet, coworking access, healthcare navigation |
| **Business** | "Building" | Long-term operations | Company formation, legal structuring, Employer of Record (EOR), local director services, partnership introductions, BPO support |

**Service Philosophy Note**

> [25-50 words reinforcing approach]

*Draft:*

> We do not publish fixed pricing. Every engagement is scoped to the specific situation. Initial consultations are without obligation. Contact us to begin a conversation.

**Partner Network**

> [40-50 words on established relationships]

*Final copy:*

> Our service delivery is supported by a network of vetted local partners: Thai legal counsel for corporate and immigration matters, licensed accounting practices for tax compliance, and certified translation services for document processing.
