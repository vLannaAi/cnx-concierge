# Terms and Conditions

**CNX Concierge**  
Effective Date: January 13, 2025

---

## 1. Our Service Philosophy

CNX Concierge serves international professionals—Voyagers—relocating to Northern Thailand. We call our clients Voyagers because they are defined by intention, not just movement. They cross borders to participate, not consume.

The finest concierge never waits to be asked. We anticipate needs, prepare solutions, and execute with discretion. Every client receives the same standard of care: punctuality, accuracy, professional documentation, and complete attention to their specific journey. We do not use client tiers or membership levels. Every engagement is treated as if you are our only client.

These Terms and Conditions govern the relationship between you (the Client) and CNX Concierge. By engaging our services, you agree to these terms.

---

## 2. Service Scope and Engagement

**Services Provided:**  
CNX Concierge offers comprehensive support for international professionals in Northern Thailand, including but not limited to:
- Visa processing and immigration support (DTV, extensions, 90-day reports)
- Settlement services (accommodation, banking, utilities, coworking access)
- Company formation and legal structuring
- Business development and strategic partnerships
- Employer of Record (EOR) and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services

**Service Delivery:**  
Each engagement begins with an initial consultation to understand your specific needs. We provide transparent scoping and pricing before work begins. Services are delivered through a combination of direct concierge support and our vetted partner network.

**No Obligation Consultation:**  
Initial consultations and preliminary assessments are provided without obligation or charge.

---

## 3. Pricing and Payment Terms

**Transparent Pricing:**  
We do not publish fixed pricing. Every engagement is scoped to your specific situation. You will receive a clear proposal outlining services, deliverables, timeline, and fees before any work begins.

**Payment Structure:**  
- Initial deposit may be required for certain services (typically 25-50% of project value)
- Remaining balance due upon completion or according to agreed milestone schedule
- Recurring services (90-day reports, ongoing compliance) billed monthly or quarterly as agreed

**Accepted Payment Methods:**  
Bank transfer (Thai baht or major currencies), credit card (where available), or other methods as mutually agreed.

**Currency:**  
Fees quoted in Thai baht (THB) unless otherwise specified. Exchange rate fluctuations are the client's responsibility for payments in foreign currencies.

---

## 4. Our Full Refund Guarantee

**Commitment to Delivery:**  
If we fail to deliver a service as agreed, you receive a full refund—no questions asked.

**Refund Conditions:**  
- Services not delivered within agreed timeline (unless delay caused by factors beyond our control)
- Deliverables that do not meet the specifications outlined in our agreement
- Services terminated by CNX Concierge due to our inability to fulfill the engagement

**Refund Process:**  
Submit a refund request in writing to contact@cnxconcierge.com within 14 days of the service issue. Refunds are processed within 7 business days of approval. Refunds are issued to the original payment method.

**Exclusions:**  
Refunds do not apply to:
- Third-party fees (government filing fees, legal fees, bank charges) already paid on your behalf
- Services completed to specification but where outcome is affected by external factors (visa denials due to applicant ineligibility, regulatory changes beyond our control)
- Services terminated by the client for reasons other than our failure to deliver

**Partial Refunds:**  
If only part of a service engagement is undelivered, partial refunds are calculated proportionally.

---

## 5. Client Responsibilities

**Accurate Information:**  
You must provide complete, accurate, and timely information required for service delivery. Delays or errors caused by incomplete or inaccurate client information are your responsibility.

**Document Provision:**  
You must provide all necessary documents (passports, business registration, financial records, etc.) in the format and timeline requested.

**Timely Payment:**  
Payment according to agreed terms is required for service continuation.

**Compliance:**  
You are responsible for ensuring your activities in Thailand comply with all applicable laws. CNX Concierge provides guidance and support but does not assume legal responsibility for your compliance.

**Communication:**  
You must maintain responsive communication. If we cannot reach you for more than 14 days, we may pause service delivery.

---

## 6. Confidentiality and Discretion

**Absolute Confidentiality:**  
All information you provide is held in strict confidence. We do not publish client testimonials, case studies, or reference lists. The matters we handle are confidential by nature.

**Non-Disclosure:**  
We do not disclose your engagement with CNX Concierge without your explicit written consent, except where required by Thai law or court order.

**Internal Use Only:**  
Your information is used solely for service delivery, legal compliance, and internal quality assurance. Staff are bound by confidentiality agreements.

**Data Protection:**  
Your personal data is protected according to our Privacy Policy and Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). See our Privacy Policy for full details.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

**Service Delivery Standard:**  
CNX Concierge commits to delivering services with professional care, accuracy, and diligence. However, we cannot guarantee outcomes controlled by third parties (government approvals, visa decisions, regulatory processes).

**Liability Cap:**  
Our total liability to you for any claim arising from our services is limited to the amount you paid for the specific service in question.

**No Consequential Damages:**  
We are not liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages (lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm) arising from service delivery or delays.

**Third-Party Actions:**  
We are not responsible for actions, errors, or delays by third parties (government agencies, partner service providers, banks) even when we coordinate their services on your behalf.

**Force Majeure:**  
We are not liable for failure to perform due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control (natural disasters, government actions, pandemics, civil unrest, internet/utility outages).

---

## 8. Termination

**Termination by Client:**  
You may terminate services at any time with written notice. You will be invoiced for work completed to date. Unused advance payments (minus completed work) will be refunded.

**Termination by CNX Concierge:**  
We may terminate services if:
- You fail to provide required information or documentation after reasonable requests
- You fail to make payment according to agreed terms
- You engage in illegal activity or request services that violate Thai law
- Continued service would require us to violate our professional or ethical standards

**Effect of Termination:**  
Upon termination, we will provide all documents and work product completed to date. Outstanding invoices remain payable. Confidentiality obligations survive termination indefinitely.

---

## 9. Dispute Resolution

**Good Faith Discussion:**  
If any dispute arises, we commit to resolving it through direct, good faith discussion before pursuing formal proceedings.

**Governing Law:**  
These terms are governed by the laws of the Kingdom of Thailand.

**Jurisdiction:**  
Any disputes that cannot be resolved through discussion will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Chiang Mai, Thailand.

**Arbitration Option:**  
By mutual agreement, disputes may be resolved through arbitration under the Thai Arbitration Institute rules.

---

## 10. General Provisions

**Entire Agreement:**  
These Terms and Conditions, together with any service-specific agreements and our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and CNX Concierge.

**Amendments:**  
We may update these terms by posting a revised version on cnxconcierge.com with a new effective date. Material changes will be communicated directly to active clients. Continued use of services after changes constitutes acceptance.

**Severability:**  
If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.

**Waiver:**  
Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not constitute a waiver of that right.

**Assignment:**  
You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these terms without our written consent. We may assign our rights to a successor entity.

**Language:**  
In case of conflict between English and Thai language versions of these terms, the English version prevails.
